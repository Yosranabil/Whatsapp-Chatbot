# Whatsapp-Chatbot

This project code is for a WhatsApp chatbot that uses the Facebook Graph API to send and receive messages. The chatbot is triggered by incoming messages from users and can send personalized responses based on the user's name and company. The chatbot also supports button replies, which allows users to select from a list of options.

The code is written in JavaScript and uses the Express, request, and axios libraries. The chatbot is deployed on a local server and listens for incoming webhook requests from Facebook. When a webhook request is received, the chatbot parses the request body and determines the appropriate response.

Here are some of the key features of the project code:

* Uses the Facebook Graph API to send and receive messages
* Supports personalized responses based on the user's name and company
* Supports button replies
* Deployed on a local server
* Simple and easy to customize
